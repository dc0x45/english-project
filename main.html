                        <p>Although God was not necessarily the very first reason for pre colonial discovery of America, it was certainly an important aspect of the foundation for the United States. The Puritans migrated from England to America to escape the persecution that was imposed upon them by their government / king. (PBS, 1). Also according to PBS, the “...Puritans were strict Calvinists, or followers of the reformer John Calvin. Calvin taught that God was all-powerful and completely sovereign.” (1), meaning that they were strict about their religion and that their god was the only god. However, even they over time were able to become more tolerant. We know that America today is a large melting pot of many religions and that religion is a part of the majority of Americans lives, and we (mostly) get along fine. We, as Americans, are like the Puritans in the ways of having the vast majority of our population be religious at 77% (Alper, Becka, et al., 2016) of Americans claiming to be as such. However, the modern era as well as “gold” and “glory” has made us more tolerant than the Puritans of out past.

                        <p>Glory can sometimes seem like an abstract word. To put it in less vague terms, it means honor, respect, and even magnificence. America today is too driven by this concept of glory, despite the term not necessarily receiving a lot of usage in recent years. One of the earliest examples of the foundation of this was set by the early explorers to the Americas. One of these explorers, Nicolas Perot had his journals lost to the ages, so it is interesting to examine how others wrote about him. The first sentence in one of these stories is a long winded praise towards Perot’s name, mentioning the tongues he speaks, and the trust various people have in him (de La Potherie, 1). This shows how Perot was well respected, which is a big part of glory. However, the other thing de La Potherie mentions is his ability to speak their language, which means that he had to learn these languages, and must of been one of the first to do so. What this means is that he was in pursuit of this glory, and thats what Glory is. It is a driving force that shaped how people wanted to be percived and what they wanted to do, which in turn helped shape America to how it is today.</p>
